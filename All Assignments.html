                    OnLine eXchange also known as OLX Group is a Dutch-domiciled online marketplace headquartered in
                    Amsterdam, and owned by Prosus, the international assets division of Naspers, founded in 2006 and
                    operating in 45 countries.

                    The OLX marketplace is a platform for buying and selling services and goods such as electronics,
                    fashion items, furniture, household goods, cars and bikes. In 2014, the platform reportedly had 11
                    billion page views, 200 million monthly active users, 25 million listings, and 8.5 million
                    transactions per month.

                    South African media group Naspers acquired a majority of OLX in 2010 and 95% of the company in 2014.

                    In Pakistan, OLX receives nearly 30 million views per month.

                    In India, about 99% of its listings come from used mobile and electronics, used home and household
                    goods, and used cars & bikes.OLX's operations in India, like other online retailers, has faced
                    problems with fraud and with people selling stolen vehicles, something they have made efforts to
                    address; nearly 25% of the car listings on their site get rejected.

                    In Brazil, OLX and bomnegocio.com, owned by Norway's Schibsted, combined in 2014 to create a
                    classifieds site.

                    In Kenya in 2016, farmers have reportedly used OLX to sell their produce and livestock, especially
                    chicken and cattle.

                    Over the years, OLX has become a common place for fraud, especially sellers who post fake
                    advertisements to dupe buyers upon receiving advance payment, and fraudulent buyers who engage in
                    UPI scam, phishing, and sending fake SMSes and emails of bank transfer confirmation.

                    In 2018, OLX claimed that it rejects nearly 25% of the advertisements at the initial stage; the
                    company also stated that it would work with law enforcement agencies to curb fraudulent activities
                    on the platform. Despite these claims, advertisements to sell properties of public interest, such as
                    the Statue of Unity and a former Indian Air Force fighter jet, have been posted on the site.

                        Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and
                        sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer, though Wayne sold his share back within 12 days. It
                        was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc., in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including
                        the Apple II, grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak had hired a staff of computer
                        designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success.
                        Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user
                        interfaces, such as the original Macintosh in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its
                        products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and
                        limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985,
                        Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee,while Jobs and others
                        resigned to found NeXT.

                        Apple's worldwide annual revenue totaled $274.5 billion for the 2020 fiscal year. Apple is the
